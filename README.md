 CHRISTY NOTES for development!!
 Still have to write all the documentation 
 Maybe change around with the hyperparemter test set training because its what calculates Fscore and right now im only using 10%
 PR curves i think can be made with the results/cafa_eval/ files
 I didnt see Ground truth for test set
